# 🌍 WorldSim — Adaptive Resource Scarcity & Agent Strategy Simulator

> **A multi-agent reinforcement learning simulation of regional resource dynamics, inter-region negotiation, and emergent survival strategies.**

---

## 📌 Overview

WorldSim is a simulation engine that models a set of geographically distinct **regions**, each endowed with finite, depletable resources — **water**, **food**, **energy**, and **land**. Autonomous AI agents govern each region and must independently learn strategies for:

- **Survival** — maintaining minimum resource thresholds to avoid collapse
- **Growth** — expanding productive capacity over simulation cycles
- **Negotiation** — forming, sustaining, and breaking trade relationships with other regions

Agents are not pre-programmed with fixed rules. Instead, they learn via **reinforcement learning (RL)**, adapting their strategies in response to the evolving world state, resource scarcity, climatic shocks, and the behavior of neighboring agents.

The simulation is designed to surface **emergent behavior** — strategies that arise organically — and to enable deep analysis of which approaches prove sustainable, which collapse, and why.

## 🎯 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🗺️ **Multi-Region World** | Configurable number of regions, each with unique resource profiles and starting conditions |
| 📉 **Resource Depletion** | Resources deplete over time based on agent consumption patterns and population demand |
| 🌩️ **Climatic Events** | Random and semi-random events (droughts, floods, heatwaves, fertile seasons) alter resource availability |
| 🤝 **Trade & Diplomacy** | Agents can propose, accept, or reject bilateral/multilateral trade agreements |
| 🧠 **RL-Driven Agents** | Each regional agent learns via a reward signal tied to survival, growth, and stability metrics |
| 📊 **Rich Visualization** | Real-time dashboards showing world state, resource flows, agent decisions, and historical trends |

## ⚙️ Simulation Mechanics

### Resources
Each region tracks four core resources with per-cycle depletion and optional regeneration:

| Resource | Depleted By | Regenerated By |
|---|---|---|
| 💧 Water | Population consumption, agriculture | Rainfall events, river trade |
| 🌾 Food | Population consumption | Farming investment, trade imports |
| ⚡ Energy | Industrial production, heating/cooling | Renewable investment, trade imports |
| 🏔️ Land | Urban/agricultural expansion | Not regenerated; finite |

### Agent Action Space
At each simulation cycle, an agent chooses from actions including:
- Allocate resources to **consumption**, **production**, or **storage**
- **Invest** in technology to improve efficiency or unlock renewables
- **Propose a trade** to another region (resource type, quantity, duration)
- **Accept or reject** an incoming trade proposal
- **Embargo** a hostile region

### Reward Signal
Agents are rewarded for:
- ✅ Maintaining resources above survival thresholds
- ✅ Population growth and stability
- ✅ Positive trade balance over time
- ✅ Avoiding resource collapse
- ❌ Penalized for resource depletion, failed negotiations, and regional collapse

### Climatic Events
Events fire stochastically each cycle with configurable probability and severity:
- **Drought** — reduces water and food by a regional modifier
- **Flood** — destroys land and food stocks; may boost water temporarily
- **Heatwave** — spikes energy demand
- **Fertile Season** — temporary food and water surplus
- **Resource Windfall** — discovery of new energy or mineral deposits

---

## 🤖 Reinforcement Learning Details

- **Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the default; configurable to DQN or A3C
- **State Space**: Normalized vector of [own resources, neighbor resources (visible), recent events, trade history, cycle number]
- **Action Space**: Discrete + Continuous hybrid (resource allocation continuous; trade/diplomacy discrete)
- **Training**: Agents train in parallel across regions; shared experience replay optional
- **Generalization**: Agents are evaluated on held-out world configurations to test strategy transferability

## 📊 Visualization

The visualization layer is a first-class component of WorldSim:

1. **World Map View** — Color-coded map showing real-time resource health of each region
2. **Resource Timelines** — Per-region historical charts of all four resources
3. **Trade Network Graph** — Live force-directed graph of active trade relationships
4. **Event Timeline** — Chronological strip of climatic events overlaid on resource curves
5. **Agent Decision Heatmap** — Shows action frequency distributions per agent per phase
6. **Collapse & Survival Report** — Visual summary of which regions survived, when, and why

---

## 🔬 Analysis & Findings

After each simulation run, the analysis module generates a structured report covering:

- **Emergent Strategy Clusters**: Did agents converge on hoarding, trade-dependency, or self-sufficiency?
- **Collapse Autopsy**: What sequence of events and decisions led to regional collapse?
- **Trade Network Stability**: Which trade partnerships lasted? Which were exploitative?
- **Climate Resilience**: Which strategies survived repeated climatic shocks?
- **Real-World Parallels**: Commentary mapping simulation outcomes to documented real-world resource conflict patterns (e.g., water wars, energy embargoes, food aid dependency)
